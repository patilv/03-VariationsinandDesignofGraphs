The presentation is derived from the material presented in Chapter 6 (Fundamental variations of graphs) of Stephen Few's book, "Show Me the Numbers", Edward Tufte's book, "Visual Display of Quantitative Information", and notes on Tufte's work by John Boyd ([How to graph badly](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jpboyd/sciviz_1_graphbadly.pdf) and [Tufte's Gospel](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jpboyd/eng403_chap2_tuftegospel.pdf))    

Almost all graphs used in this presentation were created using ggplot2.
